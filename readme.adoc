# cljs-require-order-bug

Seems to be caused by https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJS-3056.

Minimal example to demonstrate the problem caused by trying to do "ns preloading" using `:require`.

. Run `./dev.sh`. Page will be open in browser.
. Open browser console to see the logs.
    
**Actual:** `Error: No method in multimethod 'app.lib/greeting' for dispatch value: :world`.

**Expected:** `Hello World!` is printed.

Seems to be caused by the incorrect order of requiring compiled files
(traced by manually putting `console.log` at the beginning of each file):

....
main.js
out/lib.js
out/world.js
out/preload.js
out/main.js
....

Intuitively expected order (as dictated by the order of requires in `main.cljs`):

....
main.js
out/lib.js
out/preload.js
out/world.js
out/main.js
....

Issue is also reproducible on advanced compilation (`./min.sh`).
